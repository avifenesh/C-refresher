# Integrated Project Context & Goals

This is a focused systems programming project aiming to build a **high-performance, embedded, kernel-accelerated hybrid database engine** specialized for **vector similarity search, graph traversal, and full-text search** with ultra-low latency and memory efficiency, targeted at **ARM64/Raspberry Pi** platforms.

It combines:

* Your existing **C refresher kernel module** for vector operations with IOCTL interface and NEON SIMD acceleration,
* A **Rust user-space client** for safe and efficient communication,
* And the new ambition to push **kernel-level zero-copy communication, multi-modal query fusion, memory-efficient structures, and SIMD-optimized query execution.**

---

## Core Architecture

* **Kernel Module (C):**
  Implements vector store, graph indices, and text indexes inside the kernel. Exposes a character device `/dev/vss` with IOCTL commands to add/query vectors and metadata. Implements kernel-accelerated query logic using ARM NEON SIMD and zero-copy shared memory.
  Incorporates kernel patterns such as miscdevice, kfifo ring buffers, slab allocators, and Netlink sockets for advanced IPC.

* **User-Space Client (Rust):**
  Rust API wrapping IOCTL and Netlink calls safely with `nix` crate and zero-copy buffers, enabling embedding in edge devices and other constrained environments.

* **Data Structures:**

  * Vector indices (e.g., HNSW variants) memory-mapped or shared memory based
  * Compressed adjacency graph representation optimized for SIMD traversal
  * Lightweight inverted text indexes supporting approximate matching and ranking

---

## Development Standards

### C Programming & Kernel Development

* Use kernel-style C (GNU11) with strict compile flags:
  `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-sign-compare -std=gnu11 -fno-strict-aliasing -march=armv8-a`
* Follow Linux kernel coding style and error handling best practices
* Use `kmalloc`, `kfree`, slab allocators, and ring buffers (kfifo) for data storage and eviction strategies
* Implement IOCTL commands: `ADD_VECTOR`, `QUERY_TOP_K`, `GET_STATS`, extended for graph & text queries
* Use ARM NEON intrinsics for SIMD acceleration on vector math and traversal operations
* Employ zero-copy communication patterns and shared memory buffers between kernel and user space to minimize syscall overhead

### Rust Integration

* Use `nix` for system calls (IOCTL, Netlink) with safe wrappers and proper error handling using `Result`
* Use `serde` for serializing metadata and complex query parameters where needed
* Design API to support embedded usage and potential edge deployments

### Performance & Optimization

* Prioritize ultra-low latency with kernel acceleration and zero-copy interfaces
* Optimize memory layout for cache locality and compression
* Use SIMD (NEON) vectorization for query execution speedup
* Implement compact indexing to support large but primarily in-memory datasets with growth path to memory-mapped fallback
* Explore Netlink sockets for event notifications and efficient asynchronous communication
