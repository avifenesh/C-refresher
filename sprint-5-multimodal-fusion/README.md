# Sprint 5: Multi-Modal Query Fusion - Practice Area

This directory is for **YOUR** final integration implementations.

## Your Tasks

### Issue #22: Unified query interface for vector+graph+text
**File to create**: `unified_query.c`
- **CAPSTONE PROJECT** - integrate all previous learning!
- Design API for multi-modal queries

### Issue #23: Lightweight inverted text indexes
**File to create**: `text_index.c`
- Implement efficient text search structures
- Optimize for memory usage

### Issue #24: SIMD-accelerated graph traversal engine
**File to create**: `graph_traversal.c`
- Apply SIMD learning to graph algorithms
- Optimize adjacency list processing

### Issue #25: Query fusion and ranking algorithms
**File to create**: `query_fusion.c`
- Combine vector, graph, and text results
- Implement ranking and scoring

### Issue #26: Full integration pipeline with performance testing
**File to create**: `integration_pipeline.c`
- Complete end-to-end system
- Comprehensive performance benchmarks

## Integration Approach
1. **PLAN** your architecture before coding
2. **REUSE** patterns from previous sprints
3. **TEST** each component individually first
4. **INTEGRATE** incrementally
5. **OPTIMIZE** based on profiling results

## Learning Resources
- [Database Systems Concepts](https://db-book.com/) - for query optimization
- [Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/) - for text indexing
- [Graph Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/41graph/) - for traversal optimization
- [SIMD Programming Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/introduction-to-intel-advanced-vector-extensions.html)

## Performance Targets (Test Your Implementation)
- Multi-modal queries: < 10ms latency for 1M entities
- Graph traversal: < 5ms for 6-degree separation on 100K nodes  
- Text search: < 2ms for fuzzy search on 10K documents
- Zero-copy transfers: 90% reduction in memory allocation overhead

**ACHIEVEMENT GOAL**: Build a working prototype that demonstrates all learned concepts integrated together!
