# C-Refresher Learning Progress

## Overview
This document tracks learning progress through the C refresher project focused on systems programming, kernel development, and ARM64/Raspberry Pi optimization.

**Project Goal**: Build an in-kernel vector store with user-space Rust clients for high-performance vector similarity search.

## Sprint 1: C Core Refresh & Memory Fundamentals âœ…

### âœ… Issue #1: Pointer Operations in C (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: `print_address.c`

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- **Pointer Basics**: A pointer stores the memory address of another variable
- **Address-of Operator (`&`)**: Gets the memory address of a variable
- **Dereference Operator (`*`)**: Accesses the value stored at the memory address
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Moving through memory by incrementing/decrementing pointers

**Important Details**:
- On 64-bit systems (ARM64), pointers are 8 bytes (64 bits)
- `void*` is used for generic pointer casting in kernel-style C
- Always initialize pointers to NULL to prevent undefined behavior
- Dereferencing NULL or uninitialized pointers causes segmentation faults

---

### âœ… Issue #2: Dynamic Array Implementation (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: `dynamic_array.c`

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`
- **Memory Growth Strategy**: Doubling capacity when size exceeds current capacity
- **Error Handling**: Checking for allocation failures and returning appropriate error codes
- **Memory Safety**: Always checking if allocation succeeded before using memory

**Implementation Details**:
```c
typedef struct {
    int *data;        // Pointer to allocated memory
    size_t size;      // Current number of elements
    size_t capacity;  // Total allocated space
} dyn_array_t;
```

**Critical Learning Points**:
- `realloc()` can move memory location - old pointers become invalid
- Always check return value of memory allocation functions
- Use `size_t` for sizes and capacities (unsigned, platform-appropriate)
- Growth strategy impacts performance: doubling minimizes reallocations

### âœ… Issue #3: Memory Alignment and Struct Padding (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Completed

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- **Memory Alignment**: CPU efficiency requires data to be aligned to specific boundaries
- **Struct Padding**: Compiler inserts padding bytes to maintain alignment
- **Cache Line Optimization**: 64-byte cache lines on ARM64 processors
- **Performance Impact**: Misaligned access can cause significant slowdowns

**ARM64 Specific Details**:
- **Natural Alignment**: 
  - `char` (1 byte): 1-byte alignment
  - `short` (2 bytes): 2-byte alignment
  - `int` (4 bytes): 4-byte alignment
  - `long`/`pointer` (8 bytes): 8-byte alignment
- **SIMD Requirements**: 128-bit vectors need 16-byte alignment for optimal performance

**Practical Applications**:
- Use `__attribute__((packed))` to remove padding (careful - can hurt performance)
- Use `__attribute__((aligned(N)))` to force specific alignment
- Consider cache line boundaries for frequently accessed structures

### âœ… Issue #4: 128-bit Aligned Vector Structure (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: `128_aligned_vec.c`

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: Process multiple data elements simultaneously
- **ARM NEON**: ARM's SIMD instruction set for vector operations
- **16-byte Alignment**: Required for efficient 128-bit vector operations
- **Structure Layout**: How alignment affects memory layout

**Implementation Details**:
```c
typedef struct {
    float x, y, z, w;  // 4 float values = 16 bytes
} aligned_vec_t __attribute__((aligned(16)));
```

**ARM NEON Integration**:
- `#include <arm_neon.h>` for NEON intrinsics
- `float32x4_t` type for 4-way parallel float operations
- Compiler flag: `-march=armv8-a` enables ARM64 optimizations

**Performance Benefits**:
- Single instruction can process 4 float operations simultaneously
- Critical for vector similarity calculations (dot product, cosine similarity)
- Cache-friendly access patterns

### ðŸ”„ Issue #5: Function Pointers and Callback Dispatchers (IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: In Progress  
**Files**: `vec_dispatcher.c`

**Key Concepts Being Learned**:
- **Function Pointers**: Variables that store addresses of functions
- **Callback Pattern**: Passing functions as parameters to other functions
- **Dispatch Tables**: Arrays of function pointers for dynamic behavior
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring function signature compatibility

**Syntax Patterns**:
```c
// Function pointer declaration
return_type (*function_pointer)(parameter_types);

// Function pointer assignment
function_pointer = &actual_function;

// Function pointer invocation
result = function_pointer(arguments);
```

**Use Cases in Vector Store**:
- Different similarity calculation algorithms (cosine, euclidean, manhattan)
- Pluggable memory allocation strategies
- Configurable eviction policies for ring buffer

---

### ðŸ“‹ Issue #6: Makefile with GDB Integration (PENDING)
**Status**: Next Priority  
**Files**: `Makefile` (exists but may need GDB integration)

**Learning Objectives**:
- ARM64 compilation flags for kernel-style development
- GDB debugging symbol generation (`-g` flag)
- Valgrind memory checking integration
- Assembly generation for optimization analysis

**Required Flags** (from instructions):
```makefile
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-sign-compare \
         -std=gnu11 -fno-strict-aliasing -march=armv8-a -g
```

## Additional Practice Resources
- **Training Exercises**: Located in `training/` folder
- **C Track**: Exercises complementing kernel programming concepts
- **Rust Track**: Practice for user-space client development

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Complete Issue #5**: Finish function pointer implementation in `vec_dispatcher.c`
2. **Review Issue #6**: Verify Makefile has proper GDB integration
3. **Prepare for Sprint 2**: Begin studying IOCTL and character device concepts

### Sprint 2 Preparation Reading:
- **Linux Device Drivers (LDD3)**: Character device fundamentals
- **Miscdevice Interface**: Simplified character device registration
- **IOCTL Commands**: User-space to kernel communication protocol
- **Rust IOCTL Integration**: Using `nix` crate for system calls
